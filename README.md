# subcon

## The idea?
- The aim was to build a CLI(Command line interface) application that acts similar to a note taking app
but much better, faster and sleek.
- I felt the need to create this app when I found myself opening the notes app on my mobile or the to do app on ubuntu which often took me out of the flow state while working. I didn't want to use separate applications or devices to watch my subconscious thoughts, tasks, ideas.
- Anticipated key features : 
  1. memory 
  2. colorful ui
  3. bespoke
  4. a search feature
  5. assign priority, sort as per priority
  6. ideal for storing bookmarks/links too
  7. ability to create subclasses/groups like youtube etc. to store bookmarks locally

- The main issue to look forward to is that at the time of creating this project I have no experience
working on any python project, I don't know what technology to use, how to manage the memory, etc. literally nothing, hence this project because it seems tough for me though it might not be for others and would be a good learning experience and first of all it would get me out of the stagnant state I am in right now(i.e. not working on any projects).
